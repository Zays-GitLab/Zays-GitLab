maxProduct

The first solution uses brute force, examining each pair of numbers in the array. It uses two nested loops, the outer loop scanning each element, and the inner loop comparing it with the remaining elements. If a product larger than the previously recorded one is found, it replaces the maximum product and the pair that created it. Eventually, it subtracts one from each of the maximum pair and multiplies them for the final result. The time complexity is O(n^2) due to two nested loops, while the space complexity is O(1) since only a fixed number of variables are stored.

The second solution sorts the array and multiplies the last two elements (the largest ones), subtracting one from each before multiplying as per the problem's requirement. The time complexity is O(n log n), the complexity of sorting, and the space complexity is O(1) assuming an in-place sort, otherwise, it can be O(n).

The third solution keeps track of the two largest numbers in a single pass of the array, updating these two values as needed. For the case of two large negative numbers, it also tracks the two smallest numbers. The final result is the maximum of the products obtained from the largest and smallest pairs (each subtracted by one). The time complexity is O(n) for a single pass over the array, and the space complexity is O(1) for storing the pairs and their products. The main trick here is understanding that the maximum product could come from either the two largest numbers or the two smallest numbers, and efficiently tracking these pairs in one loop iteration.


find_duplicates

The first solution works by counting the occurrence of each number in a list using a dictionary. For every value, it checks if it's already in the dictionary. If not, it's added and its count is set to one. If it exists, its count is incremented. Finally, it iterates over the dictionary and adds values with a count greater than one to the result list. Its time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list, and its space complexity is also O(n) in the worst-case scenario. This solution may not meet the problem's criteria if modifying the array or using more than O(1) extra space is not allowed.

The second solution uses a list to keep track of seen elements. As it iterates over the list, it checks if each value is already in the seen list. If not, it's added. If it is, it's added to the result list. The time complexity is O(n^2) due to the O(n) operations involved in checking and adding values to the list, and the space complexity is O(n) in the worst-case scenario. Like the first solution, this one may not meet the problem's constraints if we cannot use more than O(1) extra space.

The final solution uses the list indices to mark seen elements. When it encounters a number, it goes to the index equal to the absolute value of that number minus one and negates the value there. If a negative value is encountered, it means the index has been visited before, so the absolute value of that number is added to the result list. This solution complies with the problem's constraints as it uses O(1) extra space and doesn't rely on extra data structures. It has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1).

You can step through the original list, showing how the 'seen' list gets updated and how duplicates are added to the result list. For the last solution, you can show how values at certain indices are negated and how duplicates are added to the result list when a negative value is found.
